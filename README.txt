Use your ASUSTOR NAS in flows!
Note: Enable EZConnect services on your NAS to use this app.

Enter the EZConnect Cloud ID during pairing, and enter your username and password afterwards.
This app uses polling from either LAN, WAN or the EZConnect Web Relay, whichever is availalble.
The app first checks LAN, then WAN (direct IP or MyASUSTOR DDNS) and then uses the web relay as a last resort because the web relay isn't always reliable.
